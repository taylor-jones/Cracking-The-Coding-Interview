# Cracking The Coding Interview
The goal is to implement and demonstrate solutions to each of the problems in Cracking The Coding Interview - 5th Edition, using each of:
- C
- C++
- Java
- JavaScript
- Python

The goal is to solve each problem using each language. However, the over-arching goal is understanding, rather than completion, so this I'm using this repo as a _diary_ of sorts, while I work through the book and work on developing my understanding of the languages and concepts.

### 1. Arrays and Strings

| #  	| Description| C   | C++ | Java  | JS  | Python
|---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  
|1.1	|Implement an alogirthm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?	|	  |	  |	[Java](1_arrays_and_strings/1.1/java/Main.java)  | [JS](1_arrays_and_strings/1.1/js/main.js)  |  
|1.2	|Implement a function void recerse(char* str) in C or C++ which reverses a null-terminated string.	| [C](1_arrays_and_strings/1.2/main.c)	  |	[C++](1_arrays_and_strings/1.2/main.cpp)  |	  |    |  
|1.3	| Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.	| 	| [C++](1_arrays_and_strings/1.3/cpp/main.cpp)	| [Java](1_arrays_and_strings/1.3/java/Main.java)	|  |  
|1.4	|	Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. |	| 	|	[Java](1_arrays_and_strings/1.4/java/Main.java)  | [JS](1_arrays_and_strings/1.4/js/main.js) |  
|1.5	|	Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. |	  | [C++](1_arrays_and_strings/1.5/cpp/main.cpp)	 |	[Java](1_arrays_and_strings/1.5/java/Main.java)  |  |  
|1.6	| Given an image represented by a NxN matrix, where each pixel in the images is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees.	|	  |	  |	  |   |  
|1.7	|	Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0. |	  |	  |	  |   |  
|1.8	|	Assume you have a method isSubString which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubString. |	  |	  |	  |  |
